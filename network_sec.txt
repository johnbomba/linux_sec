######################### network security #########################
# Network Services:
    Daemons servers
    listen on network ports
    constanlty runnin in the background
    output recorded to log files
    designed to preform a single task 

# Securing Network services
    use a dedicated user for each service
        take advantage of privilege separattion
    ports below 1024 are privileged
        use root to open them then drop privileges
        configureation controlled bu each service
    stop and uninstall unused services
    avoid unsecure services 
        use ssh instead of telnet, rlogin, rsh and ftp
    stay up to date with patches 
        install services provided by your distro - avoid manually doing it 
    only listen on required interfaces and addresses  

# examlpe
    instead of allowing a db to open port 3306 on a webserver exposing that port to the internet.
    open port 3306 on local host and to allow only the services that need to access the db to
    access it. 

######################### information leakage #########################

# avoid revealig information where ever possible 
    examples:
    when a webserver reports it's name version and sometimes OS in an http header 

    /etc/motd
    /etc/issue
    /etc/issue.net

######################### displaying services #########################
systemctl                   - displays all running services 

systemctl stop <service>    - stops for now will resume on reboot
systemctl disable <service> - disables even after reboot

# list listening programs with netstat
nestat -nutlp 
    -n                      - numeric
    -u                      - include udp
    -t                      - include tcp 
    -l                      - dispaly only listening sockets
    -p                      - shows PID 

# or you can use nmap 
nmap localhost
nmap <ip>   

# or lsof
lsof -i                     - may need sudo 

# test specific ports 
telnet:
    telnet <hostname or address> <port>
Netcat
    nc <hostname or address> <port>

# Xinetd controlled services 
/etc/ninetd.d/<service>
to disable service 
    disable = yes           - add to service file
to diable xinetd:
    systemctl stop xinetd
    systemctl disable xinetd


######################### securing ssh #########################
ssh = Secure SHell
allows key basked authentication 

# to ensure key based auth 
/etc/ssh/ssh_config
    pubkeyauthentication yes

# to generate an ssh key 
ssh-keygen                      - you can create a passphrase or just hit enter to bypass
    creates
        ~/.ssh/id_rsa           - private key 
        ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub       - public key 

# to copy an ssh key
ssh-copy-id <user>@<host>       - copies the ssh public key to the remote host computre

~/.ssh/authorized_keys          - where the public key winds up after the above command 

    # to remove a key 
    edit ~/.ssh/authorized keys and remove the key

######################### ssh port forwarding #########################
# security risk                             - with out a local firewall anyone can use the port forwarding once its set up
ssh -L 3306:127.0.0.1:3306 server1          - allows encrypted traffic via ssh to access local host port 3306 (mysql) 
ssh -L 8080:google.com:80 server1           - forwards all traffic to google.com port 80. google only sees traffic from server1

ssh -D 8080 server1                         - enable dynamic port forwarding 

# reverse port forwarding 
ssh -R 2222:127.0.0.1:22                    - creates a reverse shell 

# disable port forwarding  
edit:
/etc/ssh/ssh_config:
    AllowTcpForwarding no                   - prevents any port forwarding
    GatewayPorts no                         - controlls wether remote hosts can connect to ports forwarded for the client

######################### linux firewall #########################
firewalls controll network access
linux firewall = netfilter + iptables
netfilter is a kernal framework
iptables is a packet selection system
Use iptables command to control the firewall

incoming packet
    network ----> PREROUTING ----> INPUT ----> local system

inbound packet destined for another host
    network --> PREROUTING --> FORWARD --> POSTROUTING --> network

packet that originates from teh system
    local system --> OUTPUT --> POSTROUTING --> network

# creating rules
rules - Match + target
Match by:
    protocaol
    source/dest IP or network
    source/dest ip or port
    network interface
example:
    protocol:TCP, source IP:1.2.3.4, dest port:80
targets:
    chain
    built-in targets:
        ACCEPT              - accepts and stops proccessing rules int he chain
        DROP                - silently ignores the packet and stops proccessing rules in the chain
        REJECT              - like drop but will notify sender it was not accepted
        LOG                 - logs packet and cont proccessing rules in teh chain
        RETURN              - causes the current packet to stop traveling through the current chain
            # if this happens in a sub chain the packet will return to the calling chain 
            # if this happens in a main chain the defaul poilicy of the chain will be applied

UFW (Uncomplicated FireWall - ubuntu
GUFW - graphical interface to UFW

######################### tcp wrappers #########################
only controll connection access to servces are wrapped 

ldd         - prints req libraries 

#ex:

ldd /usr/bin/sbin/sshd | grep libwrap 
    returns:
libwrap.so.0 => /lib64/libwrap.so.0(0x00007f10219f8000)

can control access by IP address/networks       - like a firewall 
can control access by hostname                  - unline a firewall 
transparent to client and service               


# popular tcp wrapper
Xinetd
    cenralized management for multiple metwork services 
    runtime configuration - changes take place immediately no need to restart/reload

# configure tcp wrappers
#host acces files
/etc/hosts.allow    - checked first if a match is found access is granted
/etc/hosts.deny     - checked next if a match is found access is denied and logged

if there is not matches found is allow or deny access is granted 

#rules
formatted the same for allow and deny
one rule per line 
format: 
    SERVICE(S) : CLIENT(S) [: ACTION(S)]
    <service(s) : <client(s) [:<action(s)]
ex:
    sshd : 10.11.12.13              
    sshd, imapd : 10.11.12.13               - multiple services can be seperated by a comma
    ALL : 10.11.12.13                       - ALL is a wildcard 

    sshd : 10.11.12.13, 1.2.3.4             - multiple clients can be seperated by a comma too 
    sshd : jumpbox.example.com              - hostnames are good too here anything from jumbox.example.com will return true
    sshd : .example.com                     - here anything from .example.com will return true 
                                              for example admin.example.com or webdev.example.com will return true
    sshd : jumpbox*.example.com             - will allow things like jumpbox4admins.example.com to return true 
    sshd : jumpbox0?.example.com            - ? wildecard jumpbox03.example.com 

    sshd : 10.11.12.                        - allows any ips that start with 10.11.12.
    sshd : 10.                              - allows any ips that start with 10.
    sshd : 10.11.0.0/255.255.0.0            - allows any ips that meet the ip and netmask pair 
    sshd : /etc/hosts.sshd                  - will match any hosts listen in teh /etc/hosts.sshd file 
    imapd : ALL                             - allows imapd to  accept all
    impad : ALL EXCEPT .hackers.net         - allows imapd to accept all except for anyone connecting from any .hackers.net 
    sshd : 10.11.12.13 : severity emerg     - generates an emergency msg if there is a connection from 10.11.12.13
    sshd : 10.11.12.13 : severity local0.alert  - follows the rules in local0.alert for logs 
    sshd : .hackers.net : spawn \
    /usr/bin/wall "attack in progress"      - executes the wall command when someone trys to ssh into the system from .hackers.net
    /usr/bin/wall "attack from %a"          - shows the clients ip address
        #expansions:
        %a (%A)                             - the clinet (server) host address
        %c                                  - client information
        %d                                  - the daemon process
        %h (%H)                             - the client (server) host name or address
        %n (%N)                             - the client host name 
        %p                                  - the daemon PID
        %s                                  - server information
        %u                                  - client user name (or "unknown")
        %%                                  - expands to a single '%' character
