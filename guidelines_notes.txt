Keep services on diff systems
encrypt data transmission 
    esp authntication 

# use the following options for 
    ftp             - sftp
    telnet          - ssh
    SNMP v1/v2      - SNMPv3
    http            - https 

# do not use shared accounts 

# each application should have its own acct 

# never log into root directly 
    control and monitor access with sudo 
    sudo creates a log 

# maintian accounts
    create and use a process for removing access

# use multifactor authentication 
    something you know + something you have or something you are 
     or 
    password + biometric 

# principle of least privilege 
    aka only use root when required 
    avoid running serivices as root
    use the most restrictive permissions to only allow people enough services to do thier job
    # ex : a db does not need root priv 
    
# monitor system activity 
    routinely review logs 
    send logs to a remote logging system 

# use firewall 
    linux has a builtin firewall 
        netfilters + iptables
    only allow network connections from sources that require it 

# encrypt your data 
    Encryption protects yuor data while it is at rest
